**I'm Mike - a junior software developer from the North East Scotland.  Having just completed <a href="https://codeclan.com/courses/professional-software-development/">CodeClan_ Professional Software Development</a> I am eager to explore the next steps of working as a professional developer.**

In the meantime I am working on tidying up my rather messy GitHub repositories and practicing my skills.  I have also volunteered for the <a href="https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/">Scottish Tech Army</a> and <a href="https://codebar.io/">Codebar</a>.

## Languages, Frameworks and Libraries
I enjoy all aspects of development from backend engineering to creating solid and accessible content with semantic HTML and CSS.

## Iâ€™m currently working on ...

- consolidating my learning from CodeClan
- Learning new React design patterns and auth flows
- preparing myself to be useful to the STA by gaining familiarity in (Python) Odoo and Scorm.
- Deep diving into accessibility and semantics of HTML/CSS and improving the general user experience of code I write.
- giving a nod to graphical design fundementals that may improve the look and feel of the front end.
- setting up the perfect development environment
- preparing for the great job hunt!

### HTML5 and CSS3
[![HTML5][HTML5-pic]][HTML5-url] [![CSS3][CSS3-pic]][CSS3-url]

I often feel HTML and CSS are overlooked and not given the respect they deserve, especially when it comes to semantics and accessibility.  I feel an absolute responsibility to write HTML and CSS that is pragmatic, semantic and accessible and continually challenge myself to improve. Â I absolutely love working on the interface between tech and human perceptions.  I aim to make accessability the core of all my front end work and to be a small part of making the web useful, and enjoyable, to everyone no matter how they interact with it.

### Python
[![Python][Python-pic]][Python-url] [![Flask][Flask-pic]][Flask-url] [![Postgres][Postgres-pic]][Postgres-url]

I enjoy Python immensely! Â I have been writing bad but functional python code as an amateur for a few years, mostly to experiment with sensors, raspberry Pis and as a platform to learn about programming. Â CodeClan allowed me to level up these basic skills and introduced me to the delights of OOP. Â I love Python because it can be used to quickly test a prototype or learn something new while still being an exceedingly capable language on the backend and front-end. Â Currently, I am enjoying spending some time learning how to better leverage Python and associated libraries like Flask and Jinja2 templating while introducing myself to PEP8 and the wider Zen of Python. Â 


### JavaScript

I have a firm grounding in vanilla JS and am comfortable using React and NodeJS. Â Currently, I am learning new React design patterns while consolidating my vanilla JS skills.

My next step on this journey will be learning TypeScript and another framework, most likely Vue or NextJS.

### Java
[![Java][Java-pic]][Java-url] [![Spring][Spring-pic]][Spring-url] [![SpringBoot][SpringBoot-pic]][SpringBoot-url]

CodeClan introduced me to Java development using vanilla Java and Java with Spring Boot. Â I very much look forward to continuing with this amazing language and its frameworks. Â I very much enjoy the rigidity and discipline of the language and how it encourages clean, test driven, code. Â 

I am looking forward to gaining comfort with tooling that languages like Java use as well as learning to leverage the amazing features of modern IDE's to produce well written code efficiently.

Learning the fundamentals of Java has changed my mindset and allowed me a deeper understanding of programming methadologies and the development process as a whole.Â  I am very keen to take these oppertunities and learn a new statically typed language like C# and/or Go, Rust or C++.

### Other Skills

- LAMP Stack 
- Basic Linux Server installation and configuration
- familiarity installing and configuring Apache2, NginX, PHP, MySQLd, Sendmail, Postfix, Bind and others.
- Awareness of network infrastructure and protocols such as IMAP, SMTP/POP3/IMAP, DNS, HTTP(S), MQTT, etc 
- AX25 Radio Networking
- Microcontroller and hardware projects.
- Sensors (Command and Control) using microcontrollers, Linux and MQTT
- Adobe Photoshop (Image compositing, Layout design, Image editing)
- Figma
